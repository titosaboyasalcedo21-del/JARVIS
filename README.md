# JARVIS

**Just A Rather Very Intelligent System.**

A voice-first AI assistant that runs on your Mac. Talk to it, and it talks back -- with a British accent, dry wit, and an audio-reactive particle orb straight out of the MCU.

JARVIS connects to your Apple Calendar, Mail, and Notes. It can browse the web, spawn Claude Code sessions to build entire projects, and plan your day -- all through natural voice conversation.

## What It Does

- **Voice conversation** -- speak naturally, get spoken responses with a JARVIS voice
- **Builds software** -- say "build me a landing page" and watch Claude Code do the work
- **Reads your calendar** -- "What's on my schedule today?"
- **Reads your email** -- "Any unread messages?" (read-only, by design)
- **Browses the web** -- "Search for the best restaurants in Austin"
- **Manages tasks** -- "Remind me to call the client tomorrow"
- **Takes notes** -- "Save that as a note"
- **Remembers things** -- "I prefer React over Vue" (it remembers next time)
- **Plans your day** -- combines calendar, tasks, and priorities into a plan
- **Sees your screen** -- knows what apps are open for context-aware responses
- **Audio-reactive orb** -- a Three.js particle visualization that pulses with JARVIS's voice
- **Siri-style overlay** -- launch JARVIS without opening Chrome using the Linux overlay helper

## Requirements

- **macOS** (uses AppleScript for Calendar, Mail, Notes integration)
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Anthropic API key** -- powers the AI brain ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))
- **Fish Audio API key** -- powers the voice ([get one here](https://fish.audio/))
- **Claude Code CLI** -- for spawning dev tasks ([install here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code))

> Note: The browser-based frontend is optional. The primary interaction mode is the Linux overlay orb.

## Quick Start (with Claude Code)

The fastest way to get running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis.git
cd jarvis
claude
```

Claude Code will read the project's `CLAUDE.md` and walk you through setup step by step -- API keys, dependencies, SSL certs, everything.

## Manual Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis.git
cd jarvis

# 2. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (see below)

# 3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Generate SSL certificates (needed for secure WebSocket)
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=localhost'

# 5. Start the backend (Terminal 1)
python server.py

# 6. Start the Linux overlay (Terminal 2)
python desktop-overlay/linux_overlay.py

That is all you need. The overlay is the main interface, and no browser is required.


This opens a frameless orb window for JARVIS without using a browser.

```

## Configuration

Edit your `.env` file:

```env
# Required
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here
FISH_API_KEY=your-fish-audio-api-key-here

# Optional -- your name (JARVIS will address you personally)
USER_NAME=Tony

# Optional -- specific calendar accounts (comma-separated)
# Leave empty to auto-discover all calendars
CALENDAR_ACCOUNTS=you@gmail.com,work@company.com
```

## Architecture

```
Microphone -> STT input -> WebSocket -> FastAPI -> Claude (Haiku) -> Fish Audio TTS -> WebSocket -> Speaker
                                                |
                                                v
                                        Claude Code Tasks
                                        (spawns real dev work)
                                                |
                                                v
                                        AppleScript Bridge
                                        (Calendar, Mail, Notes, Terminal)
```

| Layer         | Technology                                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Backend       | FastAPI + Python (`server.py`, ~2300 lines)  |
| Interface     | Linux overlay helper + Three.js particle orb |
| Communication | WebSocket (JSON messages + binary audio)     |
| AI (fast)     | Claude Haiku -- low-latency voice responses  |
| AI (deep)     | Claude Opus -- research and complex tasks    |
| TTS           | Fish Audio with JARVIS voice model           |
| System        | AppleScript for all macOS integrations       |

## How the Voice Loop Works

1. You speak into your microphone
2. Speech transcription is provided by an available STT source and sent to the server via WebSocket
3. The transcript is sent to the server via WebSocket
4. JARVIS detects intent -- conversation, action, or build request
5. For actions: spawns a Claude Code subprocess or runs AppleScript
6. Generates a response via Claude Haiku (optimized for speed)
7. Fish Audio converts the response to speech with the JARVIS voice
8. Audio streams back to the browser via WebSocket
9. The Three.js orb deforms and pulses in response to the audio
10. Background tasks notify you proactively when they complete

## Features in Detail

### Action System

JARVIS uses action tags to trigger real system actions:

- `[ACTION:BUILD]` -- spawns Claude Code to build a project
- `[ACTION:BROWSE]` -- performs research or lookup; may open a browser if explicitly requested
- `[ACTION:RESEARCH]` -- deep research with Claude Opus, outputs an HTML report
- `[ACTION:PROMPT_PROJECT]` -- connects to an existing project via Claude Code
- `[ACTION:ADD_TASK]` -- creates a tracked task with priority and due date
- `[ACTION:REMEMBER]` -- stores a fact for future context

### Memory System

JARVIS remembers things you tell it using SQLite with FTS5 full-text search. Preferences, decisions, and facts persist across sessions.

### Calendar & Mail

All macOS integrations use AppleScript -- no OAuth flows, no token management. Just native system access. Mail is intentionally read-only for safety.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Some areas that could use work:

- **Linux/Windows support** -- replace AppleScript with cross-platform alternatives
- **Alternative TTS engines** -- add ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS, or local models
- **Alternative LLMs** -- add OpenAI, Gemini, or local model support
- **Mobile client** -- a companion app for voice interaction on the go
- **Plugin system** -- make it easy to add new actions and integrations

Please open an issue before submitting large PRs so we can discuss the approach.
